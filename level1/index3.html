<p><s>The angels, not half so happy in heaven</p>
<p>Went envying her and me -</p>
<p>Yes! - that was the reason </p>
<p>That the wind came out of the cloud by night,</s></p>
<p><marquee>Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</marquee></p>
<p>But our love it was stronger by far than the love</p>
<p>And neither the angels in heaven above,</p>
<p>Nor the demons down under the sea,</p>
<p>Can ever dissever my soul from the soul</p>
<p><marquee>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.</marquee></p>
<p><s>For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams</p>
<p>And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes</p>
<p>And so, all the night tide, I lie down by the side</p>
<p>Of my darling - my darling - my life and my bride,</p>
<p>In her sepulchre there by the sea,</p>
<p>In her tomb by the sounding sea.</s></p>
