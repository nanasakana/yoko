Yes! -&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThat the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
But our love it was stronger by far than the love.
And neither the angels in heaven above,
Nor the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul,
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.
For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams,
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes,
And so, all the night tide, I lie down by the side.
Of my darling - my darling - my life and my bride,
In her sepulchre there by the sea,
In her tomb by the sounding sea.</h3>
