<h1>How to Read a Long Chapter Book in Two or Three Hours</h1>
<p>It’s fun to read for pleasure but sometimes you don’t have the ability to choose how much time you get to read a book. If you need to read a book and only have 2 or 3 hours to do so, you can still get through it with some good preparation ahead of time. As you’ll see, preparing to read quickly is just as important as reading itself.</p>

  <h2>Previewing the Text</h2>
    <img src="/images/1.jpg" />
    <p><strong>1Look at the text ahead of time.</strong><br/> First, look at the table of contents. Take note of how many chapters or sections there are and how many pages are in each. Flip through the book and take notes of charts, pictures, or subsections. Take a stab at what the book will cover ahead of time, this will assist with “active reading” later.</p>

    <p><strong>2Calculate how long you should spend on each section.</strong> <br/>For example, If there are fifteen chapters and you have three hours, you should divide 180 (60 minutes x 3) by fifteen. In this example, each chapter will take, on average, 12 minutes. Whatever the amount of time you calculate, this is not a hard and fast time, it is just a tool to help you keep track of your time and progress. You need to factor in times for breaks and also understand that some chapters will take longer amount of time and some will take a shorter amount of time to complete.</p>

     <p><strong>3Review what your goals are.</strong><br/> Knowing your goals will help you pay attention to the right things and not waste time on irrelevant aspects of the book. Are you going to be quizzed on the material? Are you trying to learn a specific skill from the pages? Are you supposed to be paying attention to certain aspects of the book (a character, the way the author uses language, etc.)? Knowing exactly what you need to get out of the reading will help you focus on what’s important and not waste time reading and retaining something immaterial to your goal.</p>
